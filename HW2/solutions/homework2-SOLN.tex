{\Large Homework 2: Classification and Bias-Variance Trade-offs}\\
\end{center}

\subsection*{Introduction}

This homework is about classification and bias-variance trade-offs. In
lecture we have primarily focused on binary classifiers trained to
discriminate between two classes. In multiclass classification, we
discriminate between three or more classes.  Most of the material for Problem 1 and Problem 3, and all of the material for Problem 2 will be covered by the end of the Tuesday 2/8 lecture. The rest of the material will be covered by the end of the Thursday 2/10 lecture.  We encourage you to read
CS181 Textbook's Chapter 3 for more information on linear
classification, gradient descent, classification in the discriminative
setting (covers multiclass logistic regression and softmax), and
classification in the generative setting. Read Chapter 2.8 for more
information on the trade-offs between bias and variance.

As a general note, for classification problems we imagine that we have
the input matrix $\boldX \in \reals^{N \times D}$ (or perhaps they
have been mapped to some basis $\bm{\Phi}$, without loss of
generality) with outputs now ``one-hot encoded."  This means that if
there are~$K$ output classes, rather than representing the output
label $y$ as an integer~${1,2,\ldots,K}$, we represent $\boldy$ as a
``one-hot" vector of length~$K$. A ``one-hot" vector is defined as
having every component equal to 0 except for a single component which
has value equal to 1.  For example, if there are $K = 7$ classes and a
particular data point belongs to class 3, then the target vector for
this data point would be~$\boldy = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0]$.  We will define
$C_1$ to be the one-hot vector for the 1st class, $C_2$ for the 2nd
class, etc.  Thus, in the previous example $\boldy = C_3$. If there
are $K$ total classes, then the set of possible labels is $\{C_1
\ldots C_K \} = \{C_k\}_{k=1}^K$.  Throughout the assignment we will
assume that each label $\boldy \in \{C_k\}_{k=1}^K$ unless otherwise
specified. The most common exception is the case of binary classification
($K = 2$), in which case labels are the typical integers $y \in \{0, 1\}$.\\

In problems 1 and 3, you may use \texttt{numpy} or \texttt{scipy}, but
not \texttt{scipy.optimize} or \texttt{sklearn}. Example code given is
in Python 3.\\

% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Exploring Bias and Variance, 10 pts]
  In this problem, we will explore the bias and variance of a
  few different model classes when it comes to logistic regression.

  Consider the true data generating process $y \sim \text{Bern}(f(x)), f(x) = 0.4 \times \sin(1.2x) + 0.5$, where $x \in [-3, 3]$, and $y \in \{0,1\}$.
  Recall that for a given $x$, bias and variance are defined in terms of expectations \textit{over randomly drawn datasets} $D$
  from this underlying data distribution:
  \begin{align*}
  \text{Bias}[\hat{f}(x)] &= \mathbb{E}_D[\hat{f}(x)] - f(x)\\
  \text{Variance}[\hat{f}(x)] &= \mathbb{E}_D[(\hat{f}(x) - \mathbb{E}_D[\hat{f}(x)])^2]
  \end{align*}
  Here, $\hat{f}(x)$ is our estimator (learned through logistic
  regression on a given dataset $D$).  We will directly explore the
  bias-variance trade-off by drawing multiple such datasets and
  fitting different logistic regression models to each.  Remember that
  we, the modelers, do not usually see the true data distribution.
  Knowledge of the true $f(x)$ is only exposed in this problem to (1)
  make possible the simulation of drawing multiple datasets, and (2)
  to serve as a pedagogical tool in allowing verification of the true
  bias.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider the three bases $\phi_1(x) = [1, x]$, $\phi_2(x) = [1,
  x, x^2]$, $\phi_3(x) = [1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5]$.  For each
  of these bases, generate 10 datasets of size $N = 30$ using the
  starter code provided, and fit a logistic regression model using
  sigmoid($w^T \phi(x)$) to each dataset by using gradient descent to
  minimize the negative log likelihood.  This means you will be
  running gradient descent 10 times for each basis, once for each
  dataset.  Note that the classes are represented with 0's and 1's.
  
  Use random starting values of $w$, $\eta=0.001$, take 10,000 update
  steps for each gradient descent run, and make sure to average the
  gradient over the data points (for each step). These parameters,
  while not perfect, will ensure your code runs in a reasonable amount
  of time. The emphasis of this problem is on capturing the
  bias-variance trade-off, so don't worry about attaining perfect
  precision in the gradient descent as long as this trade-off is
  captured in the final models.

   Note: Overflow RuntimeWarnings due to \verb|np.exp| should be safe to ignore, if any. Also, to reduce stress from randomness in students' solutions (due to randomized weight initialization differences), in line $109$ of the \verb|T2_P1.py| starter code, we call \verb|np.random.seed(1738)| to set a deterministic random seed. Please do not change this! In addition, please do not change the randomized weight initialization code in lines $42-46$.

\item Create three plots, one for each basis. Starter code is available which you may modify.
By default, each plot displays three types of functions:
(1) the true data-generating distribution $f(x)$ (the probability that $y=1$ for different $x$).
(2) all 10 of the prediction functions learned from each randomly drawn dataset, and
(3) the mean of the 10 prediction functions.
Moreover, each plot also displays 1 of the randomly generated datasets and highlights the corresponding prediction function learned by this dataset.

\item How are bias and variance reflected in the 3 types of curves on
  the graphs?  How do the fits of the individual and mean prediction
  functions change?  Keeping in mind that none of the model classes
  match the true generating process exactly, discuss the extent to
  which each of the bases approximates the true process.

  Note: In this problem, we are not interested in whether the model is
  more biased for certain inputs $x$ compared to other inputs $x'$.
  We are interested in the overall bias and variance of $\hat{f}(x)$
  across the different basis choices. In other words, we want to investigate how the bias between $\hat{f}(x)$ and the ground truth as well as the variance of $\hat{f}(x)$ will be different over different basis choices. 

\item If we were to increase the size of each dataset drawn from $N = 30$ to a larger number, how would the variance change? The bias?   Why might this be the case?

\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}


            \item

            See T2\_P1\_SOLN.py code for reference.

            \item

            Students were instructed to not change the randomized seed \verb|np.random.seed(1738)| in the starter code. They were also told to not change the randomized weight initialization code provided in the starter code. Thus, theoretically, students should have identical-looking plots. Nevertheless, if a student's plots do not look identical to the plots below, please give them the benefit of the doubt.

            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis1.png}

            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis2.png}

            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis3.png}

            \item

            For basis 1, we can see that for most $x$, the difference between the green
            and black curves is quite large; hence bias is relatively high. The vertical
            spread of the individual models is relatively small; hence variance is relatively low.

            As we continue to basis 2 and then basis 3 (increasing complexity), the difference between the green
            and black curves progressively shrinks for most $x$, and the vertical spread
            of the individual models progressively grows. That is, the bias decreases while the variance increases.

            In expectation (over datasets), the more complex basis is better able to approximate the true process.
            However, we can see that it also has greater potential to overfit to specific datasets, especially when
            the number points is small.

            \item

            For this part, students should first be encouraged to experiment
            with their code. Even for up to $N = 10000$, our solution code was
            able to run in a reasonable amount of time. The three columns below
            represent trials with $N = 100, 1000, 10000$, respectively:

            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis1, N = 100.png}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis1, N = 1000.png}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis1, N = 10000.png}

            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis2, N=100.png}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis2, N=1000.png}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis2, N=10000.png}

            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis3, N=100.png}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis3, N=1000.png}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{solutions/T2_P1_plots/basis3, N=10000.png}

            With more data, we can see that the variance decreases across all models,
            which is particularly visible in the region $x \approx 0$.
            This makes sense because more data to train on provides finer constraint (across $x$)
            on the shape of the learned model. We can see however that bias
            levels off; this is due to the fact that our model families (chosen bases)
            are simply limited in how well they can approximate $\sin x$.

        \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Maximum likelihood in classification, 15pts]

  Consider now a generative $K$-class model.  We adopt class prior
  $p(\boldy = C_k; \bpi) = \pi_k$ for all $k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$
(where $\pi_k$ is a parameter of the prior).
Let  $p(\boldx|\boldy=C_k)$ denote
the class-conditional density of features $\boldx$ (in this
case for class $C_k$). Consider the data set $D = \{(\boldx_i,
\boldy_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ where as above $\boldy_i \in \{C_k\}_{k=1}^K$ is
encoded as a one-hot target vector and the data are independent.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write out the log-likelihood of the data set, $\ln p(D ; \bpi)$.

  \item Since the prior forms a distribution, it has the constraint that
    $\sum_k\pi_k - 1 = 0$.  Using the hint on
Lagrange multipliers below, give the
    expression for the maximum-likelihood estimator for the prior
    class-membership probabilities, i.e.
    $\hat \pi_k.$
    Make sure to write out the intermediary equation you need
    to solve to obtain this estimator. Briefly state why your final answer is intuitive.
\end{enumerate}

    For the remaining questions, let the
    class-conditional probabilities be Gaussian distributions with
the same covariance matrix
    $$p(\boldx | \boldy = C_k) = \mathcal{N}(\boldx |  \bmu_k, \bSigma), \text{\ for\ }k \in \{1,\ldots, K\}$$
    and different means $\bmu_k$ for each class.

    \begin{enumerate}
  \item[3.] Derive the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to vector $\bmu_k$.
    Write the expression in matrix form as a function of the variables defined
    throughout this exercise. Simplify as much as possible for full credit.
  \item[4.] Derive the maximum-likelihood estimator $\hat{\mu}_k$ for vector $\bmu_k$. Briefly state why your final answer is intuitive.
  \item[5.] Derive the gradient for the log-likelihood with respect to the
    covariance matrix $\bSigma$ (i.e., looking
to find an MLE for the covariance).
Since you are differentiating with respect to a
    \emph{matrix}, the resulting expression should be a matrix!
%
  \item[6.] Derive the maximum likelihood estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ of the covariance matrix.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Hint: Lagrange Multipliers.} Lagrange Multipliers are a method for
optimizing a function $f$ with respect to an
equality constraint, i.e.
\[\min_{\boldx} f(\boldx)\ \text{s.t.}\ g(\boldx) = 0.\]

This can be turned into an unconstrained problem by introducing a
Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ and constructing the Lagrangian function,
\[L(\boldx, \lambda) =  f(\boldx) + \lambda g(\boldx).\]

It can be shown that it is a necessary condition that the optimum
is a critical point of this new function. We can find this point by solving two equations:

\[\frac{\partial L(\boldx, \lambda)}{\partial  \boldx} = 0  \ \ \text{and}\  \  \frac{\partial L(\boldx, \lambda)}{\partial \lambda} = 0 \]


\paragraph{Cookbook formulas.} Here are some formulas you might want to consider
using to compute difficult gradients. You can use them  in the homework
without proof. If you are looking to hone your matrix calculus skills, try to
find different ways to prove these formulas yourself (will not be part of the
evaluation of this homework). In general, you can use any formula from the matrix cookbook,
as long as you cite it. We opt for the following common notation:
$\boldX^{-\top} := (\boldX^{\top})^{-1}$
\begin{align*}
  & \frac{\partial \bolda^\top \boldX^{-1} \boldb}{\partial \boldX} = - \boldX^{-\top} \bolda \boldb^\top \boldX^{-\top} \\
  & \frac{\partial \ln | \det (\boldX) |}{\partial \boldX} = \boldX^{-\top}
 \end{align*}
 \end{problem}


\subsection*{Solution}
            \newcommand{\yickindicator}{\mathbbm{1}_{\bold y_i = C_k}}
            
            % previously indicator was $y_{ik}$ which students found unclear

            Let $\yickindicator$ be an indicator variable denoting whether some $\bold y_i$ is in the class $C_k$.

            
        \begin{enumerate}

            \item The log-likelihood is given by:

            $$\boxed{\ln p(\{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i\} | \{\pi_k\})=
            \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K \yickindicator\big(\ln p(\boldx_i | \boldy_i = C_k) + \ln\pi_k\big)}
            $$

            Note that the class prior $\pi_k$ is part of the likelihood, as opposed to a \textit{model prior}


            \item

            Using the note at the end of the exercise, we know we need to maximize:
            $$\ln p(\{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i\} | \{\pi_k\})=
            \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K \yickindicator\big(\ln p(\boldx_i | \boldy_i = C_k) + \ln\pi_k\big)
            + \lambda \left(
            \left(\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k\right) - 1\right)$$


            We take the derivative with respect to $\pi_k$ and set it to $0$:
            $$\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\yickindicator}{\pi_{k}} + \lambda = 0$$

            Rearrange to solve for $\pi_{k}$:
            $$ \pi_{k} = \frac{-1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^N \yickindicator$$

            We take the derivative with respect to $\lambda$ and set it to 0 (note that this is our original constraint):

            $$\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k = 1$$

            Plug $\pi_{k}$ into this original constraint:

            $$\sum_{k=1}^K \bigg( \frac{-1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^N \yickindicator \bigg) = 1$$

            Solve for $\lambda$:

            $$\lambda = -\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i=1}^N \yickindicator = -N$$

            $$\boxed{\hat{\pi_k} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\yickindicator}$$



            Note that the MLE for the class-prior simply reflects the proportion of classes in our dataset.

            \item

            The log-likelihood can be written as such:
            $$\ln p(\{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i\} | \{\pi_k\})= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K \yickindicator
            \left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T\bSigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)\right) +
            \text{constants w.r.t $\bmu_k$}$$
            Using Equation 86 from the Matrix Cookbook, the gradient w.r.t $\bmu_k$ can be written as:
            $$\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^N \yickindicator \bSigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)}$$

            \textbf{Common Errors:} Often, people would write something like the below to indicate that the log likelihood and the exponent of the gaussian are separated by an additive constant (wrt $\mu_k$)
            $$\ln p(\{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i\} | \{\pi_k\})\propto \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K \yickindicator
            \left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T\bSigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)\right) $$
            This is technically incorrect since the lefthand side and righthand side differ by an additive constant (wrt $\mu_k$) not a multiplicative constant. The confusion may stem from the fact that we can do the same type of analysis with multiplicative constants, in which case the $\propto$ captures the proportional relationship. In other words, we could do all of this analysis before the log, which would look something like the below.
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
            p(\{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i\} | \{\pi_k\}) & = \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{k=1}^K \big(p(\boldx_i | \boldy_i = C_k)\pi_k\big)^{\yickindicator}\\
            & = \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{k=1}^K \big((2\pi)^\frac{d}{2}|\Sigma|^{-\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T\bSigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)}\pi_k\big)^{\yickindicator}\\
            & = \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{k=1}^K \big(e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T\bSigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)}\big)^{\yickindicator}\prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{k=1}^K \big((2\pi)^\frac{d}{2}|\Sigma|^{-\frac{1}{2}}\pi_k\big)^{\yickindicator}\\
            & \propto \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{k=1}^K \big(e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T\bSigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)}\big)^{\yickindicator} \\
            \end{split}
            \end{equation}
            The last line is equivalent to
            $$\ln p(\{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i\} | \{\pi_k\})= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K \yickindicator
            \left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T\bSigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)\right) +
            \text{constants w.r.t $\bmu_k$}$$
            Either methods for approaching this are fine, but just don't get confused between them!

            \item We set the previous gradient equal to $0$ to obtain: $$\boxed{\hat \mu_k =
            \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \yickindicator} \sum_{i=1}^N \yickindicator \mathbf{x}_i}$$

            Again, an intuitive answer. Our best guess for the average feature vector for a given class is the average of all feature vectors of that class in our dataset.


            \item
            Starting with the log likelihood and using the two formulas in the cookbook mentioned above, the gradient w.r.t $\bSigma$
            can be written as:
            $$\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K \yickindicator \left[ - \frac{1}{2}\bSigma^{-T} +
            \frac{1}{2} \bSigma^{-T} (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k) (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T
            \bSigma^{-T}\right]}$$


            \item

            Setting it to $0$ and multiply both sides by $\bSigma^{T}$ from the left and
            right:
            $$\sum_{i, k} \yickindicator \bSigma^T = \sum_{k, i} \yickindicator (\mathbf{x}_i -
            \bmu_k) (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T$$
            Taking the transpose (any matrix $VV^T$ is symmetric), we have:
            $$\boxed{\hat \Sigma = \frac{1}{\sum_{i,k} \yickindicator}  \sum_{k, i} \yickindicator (\mathbf{x}_i -
            \bmu_k) (\mathbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T}$$


        \end{enumerate}

% Problem 3

\begin{problem}[Classifying Stars, 15pts]

You're tasked with classifying three different kinds of stars using their magnitudes and temperatures. See star.png for a plot of
the data, adapted from
\url{http://astrosci.scimuze.com/stellar_data.htm} and available as
\verb|data/hr.csv|, which you will find in the Github repository. \\

The CSV file has three columns: type, magnitude, and temperature. The
first few lines look like this:
\begin{csv}
Type,Magnitude,Temperature
Dwarf,-5.8,-0.35
Dwarf,-4.1,-0.31
...
\end{csv}

In this problem, you will code up 4 different classifiers for this task:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

\item \textbf{A three-class generalization of logistic regression},
  also known as softmax regression, in which you implement gradient
  descent on the negative log-likelihood. In Question 2 you will
  explore the effect of using different values for the learning rate
  $\eta$ (\texttt{self.eta}) and regularization strength $\lambda$
  (\texttt{self.lam}).  Make sure to include a bias term and to use L2
  regularization. See CS181 Textbook's Chapter 3.6 for details on  multi-class logistic regression and softmax. For your implementation, use the loss and gradient expressions provided there.

\item \textbf{A generative classifier with Gaussian class-conditional
  densities with a \textit{shared covariance} matrix} across all classes. 
  Feel free to re-use your Problem 2 results.
\item \textbf{Another generative classifier with Gaussian class-conditional densities , but now 
with a \textit{separate covariance} matrix} learned for each class. (Note: 
The staff implementation can switch between the two Gaussian generative classifiers with just a
few lines of code.)

\item \textbf{A kNN classifier} in which you classify based on the $k=1,3,5$ nearest neighbors and the following distance function: $$dist(star_1, star_2) = ((mag_1 - mag_2)/3)^2 + (temp_1 - temp_2)^2$$
where nearest neighbors are those with the smallest distances from a given point.

  Note 1: When there are more than two labels, no label may have the
  majority of neighbors.  Use the label that has the most votes among
  the neighbors as the choice of label. 

  Note 2: The grid of points for which you are making predictions
  should be interpreted as our test space.  Thus, it is not necessary
  to make a test point that happens to be on top of a training point
  ignore itself when selecting neighbors.

\end{enumerate}

After implementing the above classifiers, complete the following exercises:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plot the decision boundaries generated by each classifier for the dataset. Include them in your PDF. 
    Identify the similarities and differences among the classifiers. What explains the differences?

    \item For logistic regression only, make a plot with ``Number of
      Iterations" on the x-axis and ``Negative Log-Likelihood Loss" on
      the y-axis for several configurations of the hyperparameters
      $\eta$ and $\lambda$.  Specifically, try the values $0.05$,
      $0.01$, and $0.001$ for each hyperparameter.  Limit the number
      of gradient descent iterations to 200,000.  What are your final
      choices of learning rate ($\eta$) and regularization strength
      ($\lambda$), and why are they reasonable? How does altering
      these hyperparameters affect the ability to converge, the rate
      of convergence, and the final loss (a qualitative description is
      sufficient)? You only need to submit one plot for your final
      choices of hyperparameters.

      Note: The \emph{likelihood} of the model is the probability of
      data given the model---it should not include the regularization
      term.  The \emph{objective} is the combination of the likelihood
      and the regularizer.
      
    \item For both Gaussian generative models, report the negative log-likelihood loss. Which model has a lower loss, and why?
      For the separate covariance model, be sure to use
      the covariance matrix that matches the true class of each data
      point.
    
    \item Consider a star with Magnitude 6 and Temperature 2.
      To what class does each classifier assign this star? Do the
      classifiers give any indication as to whether or not you should
  trust them?

\noindent\textbf{Problem 3} (cont.)\\


\textbf{Implementation notes:} Run the controller file, \texttt{T2\_P3.py},
to test your code. Write the actual implementations in the \texttt{GaussianGenerativeModel},
\texttt{LogisticRegression}, and \texttt{KNNModel} classes, which are defined in the three
\texttt{T2\_P3\_ModelName.py} files. These classes follow the same interface pattern
as sklearn. Their code
currently outputs nonsense predictions just to show the
high-level interface, so you should replace their \texttt{predict()} implementations.
You'll also need to modify the hyperparameter
values in \texttt{T2\_P3.py} for logistic regression.

\subsection*{Solution}


        \begin{enumerate}


        \item Your plots should look like the ones below.
        These are, in order, multiclass logistic regression classifier, the generative classifier with a shared covariance matrix, the generative classifier with separate covariance matrices, and the KNN Models. \\

        \end{center}

        \subsubsection*{What are the similarities and differences?}
        This is a pretty open-ended question, so we will generally accept a broad range of answers. A few things that should be pretty clear: 1) the generative model with separate covariance matrices seems to model the distribution better than the generative model with a shared covariance matrix; 2) logistic regression and the generative model with shared covariance perform similarly 3) KNN Models perform more similarly to the logistic regression and generative model with shared covariance than with the generative with separate covariance, but the boundaries of the KNN Models are different from the logistic regression and generative model with shared covariance as the KNN Models in that they are very non-linear


        \subsubsection*{What explains the differences?}
        Having a shared covariance matrix means that each of the three classes have approximately the same shape, which is elongated from the bottom left to the top-right of the plot. However, just from visual inspection, we can see that the three classes actually have fairly different shapes, with some being elongated from bottom left to top right, and the red ones being at a right angle to those. So, having separate covariance matrices for each one seems to lead to a better-looking fit. Logistic Regression generally performs well, but since it enforces linear decision boundaries, there is a limit to its ability to model this data. KNN also generally does well, as the data provided was pretty well organized by class, but as a model that makes predictions from the closest 1, 3, or 5 neighbors, the boundaries are bound to be more messy, as when you move from one point to another, the closest neighbors differ greatly and in a non-linear way.

        \item \subsubsection*{Logistic Regression Quantitative Analysis}

        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=.6]{solutions/logistic_regression_loss.png}
        \end{center}

        The above plot of loss during training came from using the hyperparameters $\eta = 0.001$ and $\lambda = 0.001$. You could have chosen different final values for hyperparameters, but you should have seen that training with $\eta$ of $0.05$ failed to converge and that using $\eta$ values of $0.01$ and $0.001$ led to successful convergence but differed in training time. The exact loss values will vary on different runs due to random weight initialization in the staff solution.

        Note that since we didn't explicitly require any cross-validation on testing data, there is not much to conclude about $\lambda$. By definition, loss on training data with regularization will be higher than without. Good job if you went the extra step to observe its effect on held-out data.

        \item \subsubsection*{Gaussian Generative Models Quantitative Analysis}

        For the separate covariance case, we report a negative log likelihood of 64.17, and for the shared covariance case, we report a negative log likelihood of 116.57. Note that the definition of likelihood takes the class-prior probabilities into account. We see that the whole data negative log likelihood is lower for the separate covariance case, as expected.  Allowing separate covariance matrices fits the data better, and more probability mass is given to the data points we observe, increasing the whole data log likelihood and decreasing the negative log likelihood.

        \item \subsubsection*{Test Stars}

        The test star give the following classifications:
        \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Classifier & magnitude:6 temp:2 \\
        \hline
        Generative Shared Covariance & 1 \\
        \hline
        Generative Separate Covariance & 0 \\
        \hline
        Logistic Regression & 1 \\
        \hline
        KNN Model with k=1 & 0 \\
        \hline
        KNN Model with k=3 & 0 \\
        \hline
        KNN Model with k=5 & 0 \\
        \hline

        \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        The Logistic Regression and Shared Covariance classifiers seem to disagree with the Separate Covariance and KNN classifier, and all four classifiers seem to be very confident about their predictions. It also isn't immediately obvious from the plot what the magnitude 6 and temperature 2 star should be classified as which suggests that we should be careful when relying on predictions for data points which are far from the training set.
